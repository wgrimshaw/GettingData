    "## 05 Scraping data with Requests and Beautiful Soup\n",
    "To now, we've covered means of grabbing data that are formatted to grab. The term 'web scraping' refers to the messier means of pulling material from web sites that were really meant for people, not for computers. Web sites, of course, can include a variety of objects: text, images, video, flash, etc., and your success at scraping what you want will vary. In other words, scraping involves a bit of [MacGyvering](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/MacGyver). \n",
    "\n",
    "Useful packages for scraping are `requests` and `bs4`/`BeautifulSoup`, which code is included to install these below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll run through a few quick examples, but for more on this topic, I recommend:\n",
